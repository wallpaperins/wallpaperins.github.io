    <p>Teen bedroom ideas for girls. Start with a beautiful room—the kind of room you can see your future teen enjoying—and then focus on introducing the key element of fun. These rooms are so cool your son may never want to leave home. White and pink become another major color for the bedroom, too. Plus, you can accomplish them in any room, no matter its shape or size. Teen bedroom decor for teenage girls are a little different than teen boys as girls want their bedrooms to look more friendlier and feminine. If you have textured ceilings, skip the decals and opt for a stencil and paint instead. Then it&#039;s high time to renovate their room to suit teen taste and needs. Whether you&#039;ve got one teen that&#039;s moving to a bigger room or a pair of boys sharing a small room, these ideas offer a smart solution to every need and want. A ranging color palette might otherwise overwhelm a room, but done in a funky way like this, a bevy of colors is more quirky than overpowering. You might finally get to meet more of their friends! Furniture that can function in more ways than one is very useful in small teenage bedrooms. The second example shows a bright teen bedroom that chooses bright and soft shades of blue.</p>
