    <h6>1936 bugatti type 57sc atlantic is the holy grail of sports cars.</h6>
    <br>
    <p>Only he or a few selected friends, mainly bugatti racing drivers, had the honour of sitting. The bugatti type 57 and later variants (including the famous atlantic and atalante) was an entirely new design created by jean bugatti, son of founder ettore. Type 57s were built from 1934 through 1940, with a total of 710 examples produced. The exquisite 1936 bugatti type 57 sc coupé atlantic owned by walmart chairman rob walton and the mullin automotive museum took top honors in the peninsula classics best of the best award in paris. On display usclassicmusclecars discoveries the very best cars to be video taped in 4k. The 75 year history of each bugatti atlantic is entertaining conjecture for any bugatti enthusiast. The french marquee went on to build about 800 type 57s between 1934 and 1940, but never one to be satisfied with his work, jean went about envisioning something more. The bugatti type 57 and later variants (including the famous atlantic) was an entirely new design by jean bugatti, son of founder ettore. Only he or a few selected friends, mainly bugatti racing drivers, had the honour of sitting. Bugatti has just begun construction of its new type 57, designed and engineered by founder ettore bugatti&#039;s son jean. The type 57 sc atlantic is a design manifesto of jean bugatti. The bugatti type 57 sc atlantic has, as a result, come to be seen as one of the ultimate symbols of prewar automotive elegance, more rolling statue than car, and for once that isn&#039;t hyperbole. The breathtaking proportions of this masterpiece were simply unparalleled at the time and jean bugatti had the second atlantic made for himself.</p>

The first prototype is gone and only two of three aluminum bodied. I myself once saw the atlantic belonging to ralph lauren on display in an actual art museum.
